== Scope

The data type specification presented here defines the clinical/scientific data types which are used in the Graphite Canonical Model.

The types described here have been primarily derived from the {openehr_rm_data_types}[openEHR Data Types^] and the {hl7_fhir_data_types}[HL7 FHIR Data Types^].

== Design Criteria

Over and above the need to satisfy the functional requirements of clinical data, three concerns have
driven the design of the openEHR data types:

. clarity of expression
. ease of implementation
. interoperability with data types from other standards
