= Overview

The openEHR Common Information Model defines various abstract concepts and design patterns used in higher level openEHR models.

The `archetyped` package is informed by a number of design principles, centred on the concept of 'two-level' modelling. These principles are described in detail in citenp:[Beale2000]. The `generic` package contains classes forming 'analysis patterns' which are generic across the domain, mostly to do with referencing demographic entities from within other data including `PARTICIPATION`, `Party_proxy`, `ATTESTATION` and so on.

The `directory` package provides a simple reusable abstraction of a versioned folder structure. 

The `tags` package defines semantics of annotating tags added to EHR content.
